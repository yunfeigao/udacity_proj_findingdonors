    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: ** The three supervised learning models that I am going to try are: *Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest from Ensemble Methods and Gradient Boosting from Ensemble Methods*. Here are the analysis for each model:\n",
    " - **Gaussian Naive Bayes**\n",
    "    - One example of the real-world application of the Naive Bayes model is the *email spam detection*, where a set of features in the emails are used as input to train the model to classify the email into spam or not-spam. reference [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spe.925/full). The strengths of the model are: it's a very simple model that basically uses counting to make decisions, it's fast and relatively immuned to the irrelevant features. It performs well in a classification problem and the features are independent of each other. The biggest weaknesses of the model is: it assumes every feature is independent, which isn’t always the case. Because of the model's fast speed and robustness, and given that data do have quite a few uncorrelated features, I would like to try the Gaussian Naive Bayes as a starting model.\n",
    " - **Random Forest**\n",
    "    - RF has a wide range of [application](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html), one example which is *diabetic retinopathy classification*, reference [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098587). The strengths of the RF model are its accuracy and the robustness on almost any type of data with missing values and unpreprocessed features, it's also fast to train the model. It performs well when the features are non-linear and not very clean. The main weaknesses of the RF model is that it's hard to interpret the model. Our problem has features of differenty types, and eventually leads to a \"0\" or \"1\" classification, which make the Random Forest a good choice.\n",
    " - **Gradient Boosting**\n",
    "    - One example of the application is *web page ranking*. reference [here](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3305-a-general-boosting-method-and-its-application-to-learning-ranking-functions-for-web-search). The strengths of the SVM model are its high accuracy and its tunable parameters. Since the Gradient Boosting is an ensemble method, it uses many weak learner sequentially to for a strong learner, therefore have little bias and higher accuracy in the prediction. The weaknesses of the model are its longer training time and difficulty in interpreting the results, which is a common issue for ensemble methods. It works well for the classification problem, which is the case in our example.\n"

    "**Answer: ** I believe the most appropriate model for the task is the ***Gradient Boosting***. As for this applicaion, the ability to correctly classify the people whose income is over $50K is more important than recall them from the rest, the `fscore` with `beta=0.5` is a good metric to use. The Gradient Boosting method shows the highest `fscore` of `0.74` and `accuracy` of `0.86` when trained with the full training set data and tested on the testing set data. The simulation time of the Gradient Boosting method is a little longer than the others' which ensures a more accurate model. It takes longer time for the reason that it is an emsemble model which train a lot of trees and ensemble the results in the end. The Gradient Boosting, in perticular, trains the tree one at a time and make the boosting decision based on the previous classification tree results, comparing to the quicker random forest method which trains the trees independently at the same time. It is the exact manner of sequential training, however, that makes the Gradient Boosting more accurate. Once the model is trained, the prediction take no longer time than other method. Gradient Boosting decision tree is suitable for the classification problem, like the one CharityML has, and it's built upon many weak learner as small as a two-leaf tree, so it doesn't tend to overfit the data and generally give good results."

    "### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms\n",
    "*In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*"

    "**Answer: ** During the training process, the Gradient Boosting classification tree method ensemble many weak learner into a strong learner. Each weak learner in this case would be Decision Tree. The model starts use simple rule and a few feature to make prediction, then compare the results with the training data's results. For the wrongly predicted samples, the model will add weight on them and try to set up another learner to get them right. So the process goes on until the accuracy can't be improved by using more learners. Since each decision tree grows on top of the previous result, the accuracy of this model is usually high. When using the trained model to make prediction, it goes through each feature of the testing case and average the results to make final prediction."

    "**Answer:** The above visualization lists the five most important factors are **`capital-gain`, `capital-loss`, `marital-status`, `age`**, and **`education-num`**. The first two are the same as I predicted, confirming the thought that the capital gain and loss are directly affecting the income. The `marital-status`, especially `married-civ-spouse` case, ranking number 3 is a little bit surprising. It may mean that a stable marriage will result in higher income, which also makes sense. `age` is, as expected, listed as one of the top five factors. The `education_level` in my prediction is replaced by the `education-num`, which mean the number of educational year have more weight than the actual degree the person earned, which also makes sense."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
